# CryptoTradeEnv

attempt at an OpenAI Gym environment for crypto trading, based on [gym-anytrading](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading)
dataloader is very specific for my usecase and might not be useful for you so use own datasets.

## TODO

use Close_raw for actual profit and reward predictions

## Stable Baselines that allow recurrent networks

- A2C
- ACER
- ACKTR
- PPO2
